Clients Feature Comparison
============================

The two available client types, default native clients based on ``ssh2-python`` (``libssh2``) and clients under ``pssh.clients.ssh`` based on ``ssh-python`` (``libssh``) support different authentication mechanisms and features.

Below is a comparison of feature support for the two client types.

===============================  ====================== ======================

The default client offers the most features, but lacks certain authentication mechanisms like GSS-API and certificate authentication. Both client types are based on C libraries and offer similar levels of performance.

Users that need the authentication mechanisms not supported by the default client can ``from pssh.clients.ssh import ParallelSSHClient, SSHClient`` instead of the default clients.
