``parallel-ssh`` is a non-blocking parallel SSH client library.

It uses non-blocking asynchronous SSH sessions and is, to date, the only publicly available non-blocking SSH client library for Python, as well as the only non-blocking *parallel* SSH client library available for Python.

In a nutshell
**************

.. code-block:: python

   from __future__ import print_function

   from pssh.pssh_client import ParallelSSHClient

   client = ParallelSSHClient(['localhost'])
   output = client.run_command('whoami')
   for line in output['localhost'].stdout:
       print(line)

`ssh2-python` (`libssh2`) based clients
******************************************

As of version ``1.2.0``, new single host and parallel clients are available based on the ``libssh2`` C library via its ``ssh2-python`` wrapper.

They offer significantly enhanced performance and stability, at much less overhead, with a native non-blocking mode meaning *no monkey patching of the Python standard library* when using them.

To use them, import from ``pssh2_client`` or ``ssh2_client`` for the parallel and single clients respectively.

.. code-block:: python

   from __future__ import print_function

   from pssh.pssh2_client import ParallelSSHClient

   client = ParallelSSHClient(['localhost'])
   output = client.run_command('whoami')
   for line in output['localhost'].stdout:
       print(line)

The API is mostly identical to the current clients, though some features are not yet supported. See `client feature comparison <ssh2.html>`_ section for how feature support differs between the two clients.

.. note::

   From version ``2.x.x`` onwards, the ``ssh2-python`` based clients will *become the default*, replacing the current ``pssh_client.ParallelSSHClient``, with the current clients renamed.
