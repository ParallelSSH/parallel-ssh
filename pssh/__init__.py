"""Asynchronous parallel SSH library

parallel-ssh uses asychronous network requests - there is *no* multi-threading nor multi-processing used.

This is a *requirement* for commands on many (hundreds/thousands/hundreds of thousands) of hosts which would grind a system to a halt simply by having so many processes/threads all wanting to execute if done with multi-threading/processing.

The `libev event loop library <http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html>`_ is utilised on nix systems. Windows is not supported.

See :mod:`pssh.ParallelSSHClient` and :mod:`pssh.SSHClient` for class documentation.
