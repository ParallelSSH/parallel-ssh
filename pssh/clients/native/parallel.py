        With a ``local_file`` value of ``myfile`` and default separator ``_``
        the resulting filename will be ``myfile_myhost`` for the file from host

        De-duplication behaviour is configurable by providing ``copy_args``
        argument, see below.

        This function, like :py:func:`ParallelSSHClient.scp_send`, returns a
        list of greenlets which can be `join`-ed on to wait for completion.

        :py:func:`gevent.joinall` function may be used to join on all greenlets
        and will also raise exceptions if called with ``raise_error=True`` -
        default is `False`.

        Alternatively call `.get` on each greenlet to raise any exceptions from
        it.

        Exceptions listed here are raised when
        either ``gevent.joinall(<greenlets>, raise_error=True)`` is called
        or ``.get`` is called on each greenlet, not this function itself.
